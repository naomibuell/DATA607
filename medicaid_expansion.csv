"A central goal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to significantly reduce the number of uninsured by providing a continuum of affordable coverage options through Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage for most low-income adults to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL); see this [table](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-income-eligibility-limits-for-adults-as-a-percent-of-the-federal-poverty-level/) for state by state Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults. Following the June 2012 Supreme Court decision, states face a decision about whether to adopt the Medicaid expansion. It is important to note that per CMS guidance, there is no deadline for states to implement the Medicaid expansion."
